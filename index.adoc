== Jupyter

[source,text]
----
jupyter-notebook
----

* Only `.py` in version control matters.
** `.py` for diff and `.ipynb` is for editing and checking output.
** `.md` is the output for included in asciidoc for quick reference since asciidoc cannot include `.ipynb` and we want to keep `.py` as raw file without output

---

1. Use `jupyter-notebook` to edit `ipynb`
2. Use `jupytext` to convert `ipynb` to `.py` for version control
3. `make convert` to convert `ipynb` to `.md` for view in asciidoc.

=== Sync jupyter notebook with python file for easier version control

[source,text]
----
jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:percent sample.ipynb
----

* `sample.py` would be created syncing with `sample.ipynb`
* You can choose just put `sample.py` to version control or both files.
